                       Links for Activity Streams

Abstract

   This specification details an extension to the JSON Activity Streams
   to express the serialization of arbitrary links to external resources
   based on the Link Relation model defined by RFC 5988.

1.  Link Properties

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Section 3 of [RFC5988] defines a fundamental model for Links
   associated with Web accessible resources.  This specification applies
   that model as an optional extension to the JSON Activity Streams
   formats.

   Any object included within an Activity Stream structure MAY contain
   one or more extension properties whose names follow the "${rel}"
   naming pattern where {rel} is any registered or extension link
   relation type as defined by Section 4 of [RFC5988]; and whose value
   is either a JSON String containing an absolute IRI [RFC3987] that is
   the target of the link, or an array of JSON Strings containing
   absolute IRIs in the case where multiple links with the same Link
   Relation must be specified.

   For example:

     {
       "totalItems": 10,
       "$self" : "http://www.example.org/stream/page/1",
       "$next" : "http://www.example.org/stream/page/2",
       "$last" : "http://www.example.org/stream/page/10",
       "items" : [
         {
           "objectType" : "activity",
           "verb" : "post",
           "actor" : {
             "objectType" : "person",
             "displayName" : "joe",
             "id" : "acct:joe@example.org",
             "$self": "http://www.example.org/profiles/json/joe",
             "url": "http://www.example.org/profiles/html/joe"
           },
           "object" : {
             "objectType" : "note",
             "content" : "this note has links too",
             "$self" : "http://www.example.org/notes/json/1",
             "$http://example.com/ext/rel" : "http://.../foo",
             "url" : "http://www.example.org/notes/html/1"
           }
         }
       ]
     }

   Implementations SHOULD interpret any field that begins with the US-
   ASCII dollar sign ($) character a Link Property unless the value is
   anything other than a single absolute IRI or an array of absolute
   IRIs.

   When the value is specified as an array of absolute IRIs, the
   ordering of values within the array is considered insignificant.
   Each contained value is to be treated as a separate link.  Values
   within the array SHOULD NOT be duplicated.

   When using extension link relation types, the {rel} portion of the
   property name MAY be specified as an [RFC3987] IRI but MUST be
   converted to URIs [RFC3986] when compared as required by Section 4.2
   of [RFC5988].

   As defined in Section 3 of [RFC5988], such properties can be viewed
   as statements of the form "The containing object has a {relation
   type} resource at {target IRI}" where the {relation type} is
   identified by the property name minus the leading dollar sign
   character, and the {target IRI} is provided by the property value.


2.  Security Considerations

   The mechanisms defined herein are subject to the same security
   considerations as all activities.  The presence of Link properties
   within an object does not, by itself, introduce new security
   considerations to the basic processing of Activity Streams documents.
   However, when processing specific links of a given Link Relation
   Type, additional security considerations specific to links of that
   type may apply.  Implementors need to refer to the specifications of
   each Link Relation Type to determine the relevant considerations.
